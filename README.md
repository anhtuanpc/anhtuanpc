- 👋 Hi, I’m @anhTuanNo07, you can call me Tony! :D
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, Physics and IT. I love reading literature books, playing games and doing research. That's a little bit academic!
- 🌱 I graduated at HUST, my major is "Physics Engineering", but rightnow I'm woking as an Backend and Blockchain Engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on young and dynamic organizations, I'll try my best and give all of my effort for my job. I'm looking foward to building the big carrer with you!
